# Subredditle

Guess the subreddit name in 8 tries. After each guess, the color of the tiles will
change to show how close your guess was to the subreddit. 

You may input any sequence of characters for each guess.
Playing on PC is recommended.

You will be given the description of the subreddit from Reddit as a clue.
The solution will be one of the <strong>106 top-subscribed subreddits</strong>,
each of which has over 4 million members (and is SFW).
That means the subreddit name will <strong>not</strong> be as random as the examples below. (Examples will be posted later.) 
(Also note that the vast majority of subreddit names on this list contain no numbers or underscores.)
